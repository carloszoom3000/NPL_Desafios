      "quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\n",
      "needed in other parts of the country.\n",

      "never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\n",
      "that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\n",
      "be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\n",
      "members to come out.\n",

      "     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\n",
      "to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\n",

      "     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\n",

      "unsafe conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\n",

      "given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\n",
      "evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\n",
      "that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\n",
      "convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\n",
      "increase with the passage of time.\n",

      "consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\n",
      "that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\n",
      "that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\n",
      "people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\n",
      "of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\n",

      "\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First \n",
      "of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported \n",
      "me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in \n",
      "economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it \n",
      "gives the country a very different budget for the next five years \n",
      "than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, \n",
      "at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and \n",
      "health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the \n",

      "to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; \n",
      "to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also \n",
      "to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The \n",
      "plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the \n",

      "this year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five \n",

      "I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I \n",
      "think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work \n",

      "Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords \n",
      "from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six \n",

      "\t     \n",
      "\t     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've \n",
      "got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth \n",
      "is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life \n",
      "of the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we \n",
      "have this program well below the spending targets that Congress \n",
      "has already approved for this year.  And they've done this for \n",
      "years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans \n",

      "of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I \n",

      "Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\n",
      "for destructors and caching of converted values.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several main types of resource converters:\n",
      "\n",
      "    string to data type\n",
      "    data type to string\n",
      "    data type to data type\n",
      "\n",
      "i) string to data type\n",
      "    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\n",
      "    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\n",
      "    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\n",
      "\n",
      "\tName\t\tValue\n",
      "\t\"True\"\t\t1\n",
      "\t\"False\"\t\t0\n",
      "\n",
      "    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\n",
      "    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\n",
      "    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the\n",
      "    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\n",
      "    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\n",
      "    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\n",
      "    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\n",
      "\n",
      "    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\n",
      "    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\n",
      "    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\n",
      "    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\n",
      "    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\n",
      "    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\n",
      "    of the converters.\n",
      "\n",
      "ii) data type to string\n",
      "    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\n",
      "    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,\n",
      "    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\n",
      "    probably by the use of sprintf.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\n",
      "    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\n",
      "    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\n",
      "    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state\n",
      "    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\n",
      "    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\n",
      "    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to\n",
      "    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\n",
      "    that they are consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "iii) data type to data type\n",
      "    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\n",
      "    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\n",
      "    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\n",
      "    red, green and blue.\n",

      "the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\n",
      "In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\n",
      "destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\n",
      "the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\n",
      "set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\n",
      "caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\n",
